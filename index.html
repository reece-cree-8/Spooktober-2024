    <h4><b><u>Story Telling Tradition</u></b></h4>
    <p>
      In Scotland, children participate in a tradition called “guising,” where they dress up and tell jokes or perform small acts to earn treats. This custom dates back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrating the harvest and warding off spirits. In Ireland, a similar practice exists, where kids recite riddles while trick-or-treating, keeping the spirit of creativity alive during Halloween.

    <h4><b><u>Backstory</u></b></h4>
    <p>
      Welcome to Creepy Glen, a foggy Scottish village, just ten years after the first Halloween celebration. You've heard every joke under the sun, and this year, you're ready to put the trick-or-treaters to the test. In your front garden, a sign boldly challenges children to tell you a joke you haven't heard before. If they succeed, you lose the game. <br>
      As the night unfolds, children approach your door, eager to earn their treats. Can you outsmart the clever trick-or-treaters?
